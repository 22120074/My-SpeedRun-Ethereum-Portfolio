# 🚩 Challenge 1: Decentralized Staking App

This is the first challenge of the Speed Run Ethereum curriculum. The goal is to build a **Decentralized Staking App** (similar to Kickstarter) where users can pool funds together to meet a threshold.

If the threshold is met by the deadline, the funds are sent to an external contract (e.g., to buy a shared asset). If not, users can withdraw their funds.

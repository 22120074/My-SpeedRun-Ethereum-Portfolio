# 🚩 Challenge 1: Decentralized Staking App

This is the first challenge of the Speed Run Ethereum curriculum. The goal is to build a **Decentralized Staking App** (similar to Kickstarter) where users can pool funds together to meet a threshold.

If the threshold is met by the deadline, the funds are sent to an external contract (e.g., to buy a shared asset). If not, users can withdraw their funds.

# 🚩 Challenge 2: 🏵 Token Vendor 🤖

This is the second challenge of the Speed Run Ethereum curriculum. The goal is to build a **Token Vendor** (like a Vending Machine) that handles the buying and selling of your own ERC20 token using ETH.

Users can exchange ETH for tokens and vice versa. It involves handling `approve` patterns for ERC20 transfers and managing contract balances.

**Alert**:

Ở Checkpoint 2 nên có đủ ETH để có thể giao dịch. Nếu Vendor muốn có token phải lấy từ Deloyer, mà trước đó ta phải mint vào Deloyer lẫn Ví Frontend.
